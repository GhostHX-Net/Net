This README is for Net.py
For all the tools (except name() and ip()) you need to do a input like ip_scan(user) user is a input.
And if the code is not good i am starting out in the hacking world.
I hope you like Net.py.
If you want it to be ezer do this from Net import * it will make it ezer

stuff in file:
ip_scan = port scanner you use it like Net.ip_scan(var name) and then var name=input('anything you want')
name = give you your name
ip = gives ip
scan = it tell you the ip and macs on the network
Network = will give the ip of a website use it like Net.Network(user) user = input("Enter website name># ") or any word you want


For NetV2 you have to allso make a fiel called scan.py it is allso in the menu 

new stuff:
wifi_DDoS = this is a ddos attacker for your wifi you have to have a wifi addaper with montior mode
scan = the old scan was not that good so i made it better it has 415 lines of code i think to use it you have to type Net.scan() and you have to have it saved in the same file as the NetV2 file
and the rest of the stuff is the same
